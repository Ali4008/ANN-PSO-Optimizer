# **ANN-PSO Optimization: Data Science â€” Deep Learning**

## **Overview**
This project integrates Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with a custom Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize ANN weights, significantly reducing Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on a regression dataset.

## **Key Features**
- Custom PSO algorithm designed from scratch to optimize ANN weights.
- Achieved over **60% reduction in MAE**, improving both training and test performance.
- Tested various PSO configurations to identify the optimal parameter setup.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** with NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
